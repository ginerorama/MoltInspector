# MoltInspector

*Caenorhabditis elegans* postembryonic development consists of four discrete larval stages separated by molts. Typically, the speed of progression through these larval stages is investigated by visual inspection of the molting process. Recently, an automated method to monitor the timing of these discrete phases of *C. elegans* maturation, from the first larval stage through adulthood, using bioluminescence has been developed in the Olmedo´s lab*. Moltinspector is an automated tool that enables  to analyze easily the luminiscense signal data registered at x-min interval from 96-well plates .
