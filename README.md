*Caenorhabditis elegans* postembryonic development consists of four discrete larval stages separated by molts. Typically, the speed of progression through these larval stages is investigated by visual inspection of the molting process. Recently, an automated method to monitor the timing of these discrete phases of *C. elegans* maturation, from the first larval stage through adulthood, using bioluminescence has been developed in the Olmedo´s lab*. 

Moltinspector is an automated tool that enables to analyze easily the luminiscense signal data registered at x-min interval from 96-well plates.

In MoltInspector Luminiscense data are preproccesed and transformed to binary format to identified molt phase. Several paramaters can be modified to adjust the analysis for the binary transformation and molt phases.

Figure1. Molt inspector generates a txt file showing the number of molt phases of each worn.


To make a fast inspection of the molt phases, a clustermaps analysis has been implemeted to show trend-corrected data for up to 96 independently monitored animals
